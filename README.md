# Php OOP programming example

Assignment: 
A simulation of village life on the PLO
In the summer, to take a break from the hustle and bustle of the city, you went to your uncle's farm. After a few days of rest you got bored and decided to practice programming. When you went to the hens and cows stable and saw how an automatic milk and eggs collector worked, you decided to describe its work in the OOP paradigm.

Given:
There are 10 cows and 20 chickens living in the stable;
A cow can give 8-12 liters of milk at one milk yield;
A hen can lay 0-1 eggs per clutch;
Each cow and chicken on the farm has a unique registration number.

Task
Implement, using php, an object-oriented system: a product collection prototype. Implement class structure, use inheritance mechanism.
The Farm class must be autonomous, keep track of animal numbers, collect and count products. The solution must be extensible, adding new types of animals and products should not lead to modification of the Farm class itself.

The system must be able to: Add animals to the stable one by one.
                            Collect products from all the animals registered in the barn.
                            Calculate the total amount of harvested products.

Result of running the script:
When you run the script main.php in the console:
 1) The system should add animals to the stable (10 cows and 20 chickens).
 2) Display information about the number of each type of animals on the farm.
 3) Collect production 7 times (a week) (milk the cows and collect the eggs from the chickens).
 4) Display the total number of eggs and liters of milk collected during the week.
 5) Add another 5 chickens and 1 cow to the farm (went to the market, bought animals).
 6) Again display the information about the number of each type of animal on the farm.
 7) Again 7 times (a week) collect the products and display the result on the screen.
